Jchecker is a software model checker for C-style source codes, based on the theory of predicate-abstraction.

Like other software model checkers (e.g. SLAM, BLAST...), Jchecker analyzes the source codes and constructs a model to verify it instead of the usual compile&run&test step. So it is a static program analyzer.
