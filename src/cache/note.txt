how to implements equals and hashCode();

# Easy part: equals(null) must return false.
# Difficult part: If firstObject.equals(secondObject) returns true, 
	then secondObject.equals(firstObject) must also return true.
# Hard part: If equals() returns true for two objects, both objects 
	must return the same integer from the hashCode() method.

default equals() hashCode() 
	In Java, an object's identity is based on the class of the object 
	and the memory address in JVM at which it's state is stored.
	
The default implementation of equals() method checks to see if 
the two objects have the same identity. Similarly, the default 
implementation of the hashCode() method returns an integer based 
on the object's identity. This is the strictest implementation 
of the equals() and hashCode() methods.
