source file is:

b=0;
while(b<4)b=b+1;
if(b==3)
{a=1;}
else{ ERROR;}

When calculating interpolation, foci give:

predicate is: (((0<=(3+(-1*b)))&&(b==3))||(0>(-3+(1*b))))

But vampyre can't judge, so give true and till error node.

Then return to parent node. And do it again.

This is real-counter example, but can't deduce?
